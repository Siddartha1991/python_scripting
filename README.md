# Scripts POCs
Here I store all my python scripts which I work as adhoc tasks during my work tenures

## script1: 
A python script. This helped my organization drop hive tables based on their type. Made sure all types are covered as per business usecase.
## script2: 
A PySpark/Python Glue ETL job script. This helped my organization build a Apache Hudi CDC platform to insert/update/delete data in Glue ETL Catalog.
## script3: 
A Python Lambda Function. This helped my organization share/grant databases across domains using Lake Formation API calls.
